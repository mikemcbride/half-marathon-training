# half-marathon-training

Keeps track of a 12 week half-marathon training program, which I grabbed from Hal Higdon. I think I used level 2, but could easily be adjusted by modifying `src/assets/schedule.js`.

This app will keep a localStorage key of the last race date you selected so you don't have to put it in every time. Pretty handy to bookmark this and quickly check what workout you should be doing today.

On mobile, the weeks are collapsed by default but you can click to toggle them since they take up so much space. The active week block is highlighted, and so is the active day.
